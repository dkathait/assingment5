 Student Marks in Python

This Python program allows you to search for a student's marks from a predefined dictionary using their name as input.

 Features

- Stores student names and their marks in a dictionary
- Takes a student's name as input
- Searches and displays the corresponding marks if found
- Shows a "Student not found" message if the name doesn't exist

 Code Logic

- Uses the `in` keyword to check if the name exists in the dictionary
- Accesses marks using the name as the key: `a[b]`
